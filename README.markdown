## Status

At the moment it is difficult to build the project because we are using a older
custom version of Scalate. This problem will be addressed after the release of
Scala 2.8.0.RC2. Until then feel free to clone the project and browse the source
code or clone and browse the source of the
[sample application](http://github.com/coeusframework/coeus-sample-blog).
